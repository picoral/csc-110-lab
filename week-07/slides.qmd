## How do we know a string is a number?

Assume that for both short project 07 and programming project 07 you **won't** have strings that mix digits (for example `0` and `9`) and letters (for example `a` and `x`)

How do we know the following strings are names vs. numbers (integers or floats)?

* `"Petra"`
* `"10.5"`
* `"5"`

## Check first character of a string

Remember that you can retrieve the first character of a string using `[0]`

```{python}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
name = "Petra"
name[0].isnumeric()
```


```{python}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
number = "0.10"
number[0].isnumeric()
```

```{python}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
number = "10"
number[0].isnumeric()
```
