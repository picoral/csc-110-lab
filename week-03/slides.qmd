## Logical Expressions

An expression that evaluated to a Boolean value (`True` or `False`)

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
age = 21
age >= 21
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
age > 21
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
age > 35
```

## If statements

We can use logical expressions in `if-else` statements:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
if age > 15:
  allowed_to_drive = True
else:
  allowed_to_drive = False
  
print(allowed_to_drive)
```

When the expression `age > 15` is evaluated to `True` lines `2` and `6` run, if it is evaluated to `False` line to is skipped over and lines `4` and `6` run.

## If statements

Add `elif` statement if you need to check another condition:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
if age >= 21:
  allowed_to_drink = True
  allowed_to_drive = True
elif age > 15:
  allowed_to_drink = False
  allowed_to_drive = True
else:
  allowed_to_drink = False
  allowed_to_drive = False
  
print(allowed_to_drink, allowed_to_drive)
```

When the expression `age >= 21` is evaluated to `True` lines `2`, `3` and `11` run, if it is evaluated to `False` lines `2-3` are skipped over and then `age > 15` is evaluated.
If `age > 15` is evaluated to `True` lines `5`, `6` and `11` run, if it is evaluated to `False` lines `5-6` are skipped over and lines `8`, `9`, and `11` run.
